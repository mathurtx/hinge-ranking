This project explores the hinge data and provides likelihood estimations of a player liking a subject.
The code is organized into 3 directories:
- Exploration
- Experiments
- Models

Exploration is where the initial data analysis is performed. A couple of features are added as part of the exploration. In addition, we perform smoothing on the age distribution.
Experiments contains code for building a logistic regression model and xgboost classifier.
Models is where all the models are saved.


What are some of the most important features, and why did you choose the model you did?

Why did you choose the evaluation metrics that you did? For our use case, which should be considered most heavily in making business decisions? 
Given this same dataset and more time, what additional ideas would you try out?
Make a recommendation for next steps -- what other data sources or features would you want to develop, and how would you evaluate progress of the improved algorithm?
