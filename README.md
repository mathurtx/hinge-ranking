This project explores the hinge data and provides likelihood estimations of a player liking a subject.
The code is organized into 3 directories:
- Exploration
- Experiments
- Models

Exploration is where the initial data analysis is performed. A couple of features are added as part of the exploration. In addition, we perform smoothing on the age distribution.
Experiments contains code for building a logistic regression model and xgboost classifier.
Models is where all the models are saved.
